# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
The Python "Pandas" and "SciKitLearn" libraries will be used for data preprocessing (eg. clean the data) and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python. 

## Database Storage
Postgres is the database we intend to use since the data for the topic is well structued with a specific schema. We will import and export data using SQL queries and the Python "Pandas" library.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create, train, and test a model. The order of creating a model will be the following
- Preprocessing data
- Model selection
- Model training
- Model testing and results
- Output metrics

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js and Plotly for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on Github Pages.
