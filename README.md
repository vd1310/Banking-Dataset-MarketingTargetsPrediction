## Data Analytics Boot Camp Final Project

### Covid 19 Vaccine Reaction Prediction
Using the Kaggle Covid dataset, our team will identify insights from Pfizer/BionTech, Moderna and J&J Vaccines Reactions Data Jan 2021 - July 2021. 


### Rationale:

Kaggle data set, survey COVID-19 Vaccine Reactions Data Jan 2021 - July 2021, This is US across various states 

### Github repository name: COVID-19_Vaccine_Adverse_Reactions
### Communication: slack / whatsapp / MS teams

### Technology stack
#### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.
#### Database Storage
Mongo is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.
#### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. 
#### Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. 

#### Sample data set is uploaded
