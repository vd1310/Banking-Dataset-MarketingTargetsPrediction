## Banking-Dataset-MarketingTargetsPredictionct
Using the Kaggle Banking Dataset, our team will identify insights from the avaialable banking dataset.


### Rationale:
Term deposits are a major source of income for a bank and hence it is crucial to identify the customers most likely to convert beforehand for term deposits so that they can be specifically targeted via call.

### Data Set Source
Kaggle data set, Banking Dataset - Marketing Targets (https://www.kaggle.com/prakharrathi25/banking-dataset-marketing-targets). The data is related to the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed by the customer or not

### Technology stack
#### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.
#### Database Storage
Mongo is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.
#### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. 
#### Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js / tableau for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. 

#### Sample data set is uploaded
