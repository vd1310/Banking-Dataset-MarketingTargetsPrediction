# COVID-19_Vaccine_Adverse_Reactions

## Reason
We chose this topic not only because it is one of the current real-world matters, but also because vaccines are being heavily promoted and more and more people are getting at least one dose of vaccine. There is a demand in the market for the efficacy of vaccines and to build a trust. If we could learn more about the causes of vaccine side effects, we would be able to promote vaccines better.
