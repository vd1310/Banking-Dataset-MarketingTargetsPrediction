## Overview
A term deposit is a deposit account at a financial institution in which funds are blocked for a period of time, ranging from months to years. Term deposits typically offer higher interest rates than traditional liquid savings accounts, where customers can withdraw their money at any time.
When the account holder deposits funds with the bank, it can use them to lend to other consumers or businesses. To encourage customers to deposit money in the bank, the bank will pay interest to the depositor accordingly. With most traditonal saving accounts, customer can withdraw the money at any time. This makes banks harder to paln ahead of how much money to lend out. To overcome this problem, banks offer term deposit accounts. To get a higher interest rate, the customer agrees to deposit funds in these accounts where the money will not withdraw in a period.
Term deposits are one of the major ways for banks to generate revenue. Using data analytics, machine learning to predict a potential customer's likelihood of accepting a term deposit can further increase banks' success rate in marketing them.
