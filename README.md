## Overview
A term deposit is a deposit account at a financial institution in which funds are blocked for a period of time, ranging from months to years. Term deposits typically offer higher interest rates than traditional liquid savings accounts, where customers can withdraw their money at any time.
When the account holder deposits funds with the bank, it can use them to lend to other consumers or businesses. To encourage customers to deposit money in the bank, the bank will pay interest to the depositor accordingly. With most deposit accounts of this type, the owner can withdraw the money at any time. This makes it difficult for banks to know in advance how much money they can lend.To overcome this problem, banks offer term deposit accounts. Customers deposit or invest in these accounts, agreeing not to withdraw their money for a period of time in order to hold a higher interest rate. 
Term deposits are one of the major ways for banks to generate revenue, and by using data analytics, machine learning to predict the likelihood whether a potential customer will accept a term deposit can further increase banks' success rate in marketing them.
